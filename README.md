# Bell Beater v3 (PWA)

### What’s new
- **Merged blocks**: If you pick 4B lunch, 4A+4 are merged into one class before lunch; if 4A lunch, 4+4B are merged after lunch; if 5C lunch, 4A+4+4B are one long class, then lunch at 5C.
- **Clean intro**: Lunch selection shows before the UI (no awkward overlay).
- **Focus mode**: Going fullscreen changes the layout to giant countdown + end time + next class.
- Dark theme enforced.

### How to use
- First open → choose lunch (4A/4B/5C). Change anytime with the “Lunch” button.
- “Use default schedule” is on by default. For weird days, turn it off and set custom blocks in **Settings**.
- Install via Chrome ⋮ → Install (or the Install button). Works offline.
