# Bell Beater v3.1 (PWA)

Chromebook-friendly, offline, installable bell timer with your school’s schedule baked in.

## What’s new since v1
- **v3.1**
  - **Pre-bell notifications (5 & 1 minutes)** — no sound, just native notifications (works while the app is open)
  - **Class labels & colors** — rename Period 1→“AP Bio”, pick per-period colors
  - **Progress bars** — in Today list and in Focus Mode
  - **Mini widget view** — draggable floating widget + **Pop-out** to a tiny window
  - **Cleaner fullscreen Focus Mode** — huge countdown + end time + next class
  - **Notes & links** — per-day notes and quick links under each class (collapsed by default)
  - **Double period option (3+4)** — merges into one long class when there’s no lunch in between (works with 5C lunch)
  - **Fixed lunch merging** — For 4A/4B lunch, **Period 5 = 5 + 5C merged**

- **v3.0**
  - Merged blocks around lunch based on 4A / 4B / 5C
  - Clean first-run lunch chooser (before UI)
  - Focus Mode toggled by fullscreen
  - Dark theme

- **v2.0**
  - Built-in default schedule (Mon–Thu and Friday)
  - Lunch picker (4A / 4B / 5C)
  - Template vs Custom toggle and custom day editor
  - ICS export, offline PWA, notifications (at bell)

- **v1.0**
  - Base countdown, next-up panel, today list

## First-time setup
1. Open the site. If lunch isn’t set, you’ll see the lunch chooser first.
2. Click **Install** to pin as an app (optional).
3. Go to **Settings → Labels & Colors** to rename classes and set colors.
4. **Options** tab: enable 5/1-minute warnings, and double-period 3+4 if needed.
5. For weird days (assemblies), toggle **Use default schedule** off and edit a custom plan under **Schedule**.

## Notes & Links
- Each class in the “Today” list has a **Notes & Links** dropdown:
  - **Notes** are saved per day.
  - **Links** are saved per day as comma-separated URLs.

## Mini widget
- Click **Mini Widget** for a draggable in-page box.
- Click **Pop out** for a tiny floating window you can place anywhere.

## Refreshing after updates
- Click **Refresh app** to clear cached files (or hard reload with Ctrl+Shift+R).

## Limitations (honest)
- Notifications work only while the app is open (browser security).
- Double period 3+4 won’t merge if a lunch block sits between them (e.g., with 4A/4B lunch). It **does** merge with 5C lunch.

Enjoy! 🎒
