# Bell Beater v2 (PWA)

## What’s new
- **Built-in default schedule** for Mon–Thu and Friday using your exact times.
- **Lunch picker (4A / 4B / 5C)** shown on first open + button to change later. The chosen lunch is labeled as **Lunch** in the timeline.
- **Template vs Custom**: Toggle “Use default schedule template for today.” Turn it off to run a custom weird-day schedule you edit in Settings.
- All previous features (big countdowns, notifications, ICS export, offline).

## First-time setup
1) Open the site → you’ll be asked to select **your lunch** (4A, 4B, or 5C).  
2) Click **Install** to pin it like an app.  
3) If you have a weird day (assembly, testing), open **Settings** and make a custom plan, then **toggle off** “Use default schedule template” on the main screen.

## Editing custom days
- Settings → pick the weekday tab → add/edit blocks in HH:MM (24h).  
- Your custom plan is saved only for that weekday and only used when you toggle off the template.

## Calendar export
- “Make Calendar” exports the next 4 weeks of the **template** days with your lunch labeled. Import to Google Calendar for background notifications.

Enjoy!
