# Bell Beater v3.1.1 (PWA)

Hotfix for v3.1: fixed a JS error that made buttons dead and hid the schedule.

- Added missing `render()` function (now just calls `updateNow()`)
- Bumped service-worker cache to `bb-cache-v3-1-1` to force updates
- All v3.1 features: notifications (5 & 1 min), labels/colors, progress bars, mini widget, cleaner fullscreen, notes/links, double 3+4 option, correct lunch merging (5+5C for 4A/4B)

If it still shows old stuff, hard reload and hit **Refresh app** once.
